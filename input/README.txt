The sample input files for threeUPP algorithm

Each file has three columns corresponding to states of each character.
(taxa are labled by lower letters)


### compatible_unique_1.txt

	The set of 29 characters on the set of 8 taxa. Those characters are compatible. By running threeUPP, we show that there is the unique tree.
